# Well Path Design

This is a part of the course work of "Drilling & Logging" at KIT

This project contains code for designing and plotting well paths, particularly focusing on J-type well design. The code calculates key parameters like:
- True Vertical Depth (TVD)
- Kick-Off Point (KOP)
- Horizontal distance between the potential drilling site and the reservoir target

The 3D and 2D plots generated visualize the well path.

# Future Scope
- Add other well types
